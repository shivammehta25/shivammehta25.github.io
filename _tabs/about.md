## Hello and welcome to the blog (again)!

> Again because I used to post on `shivammehta.me/blog` but I decided to move to a new platform. I will try to migrate my old posts to here to keep everything in one place.
{: .prompt-tip }

Since the start of my PhD journey around two years ago, I've focused on learning new skills or sharpening the existing ones.
Going forward, I will post new blog entries on this platform and update the old ones to add more information about the material in them.
This will assist me and others learn new things.
I will be posting more often about fun projects, math, my work, and my thoughts here.

I hope you enjoy reading my posts as much as I enjoy writing them.

Alright, I will see you around!
