## Hello and welcome to the blog (again)!

> Again because I used to post on `shivammehta.me/blog` but I decided to move to a new platform. I will try to migrate my old posts to here to keep everything in-place.
{: .prompt-info }

Since the start of my PhD Journey approximately 2 years ago, I have been focusing a lot on learning a new set of skills or sharpening the existing ones'. Going forward, I will post new blog entries on this platform in addition to revamping the old ones in order to add more information about the material in them. Hopefully, this will help me and others learn new things.

I will be posting more frequently about fun projects, math, my work, and my thoughts here. I hope you enjoy reading my posts as much as I enjoy writing them.

Alright, I will see you around!
